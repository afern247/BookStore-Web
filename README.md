# Book Store app

### This app was created during my senior class where I had to colaborate with students and learn about web dev, git, and other technologies.

How to run the dev server:

- Clone the repo

- Do the migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

- Install packages: `pip install django pillow django-crispy-forms django-countries 5.3.2 django-crispy-forms 1.7.2 django-localflavor 2.1`

- Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
