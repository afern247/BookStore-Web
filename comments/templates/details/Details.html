                <label>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                    the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it to make a
                    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining
                    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing Lorem Ipsum
                    passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                    versions of Lorem
                    Ipsum.
